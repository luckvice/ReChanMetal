## About
* Target version: **SLUS-00684**
* Development started: **October 2025**

The project focuses on:
* reconstructing game logic and systems
* rebuilding data structures and formats
* matching original runtime behavior

A large part of the work has been dedicated to documentation and understanding
the original codebase before reimplementation.

## Enhancements
Beyond reconstruction, the project also introduces improvements over the original PlayStation version:
- keyboard and mouse support  
- gamepad support with vibration, including **DualSense/DualShock light bar** and configurable vibration strength
- controller button-prompt styles (Xbox, Nintendo Switch and **PlayStation/DualSense**)
- HOR+ widescreen support  
- higher resolution rendering  
- dynamic shadows and anti-aliasing options  
- PC-specific settings and enhancements  
- **Brazilian Portuguese** localization (plus English, German, French, Italian and Spanish)
- movie subtitle support (`.srt`) and in-game save/load shortcuts  
- general quality-of-life improvements

## Getting Started

Game data is **not included**. Place a legally obtained NTSC-U game image from
your own copy (`.bin` or `.iso`) in a `discimage` folder beside the executable:

```text
rechan/
|-- rechan.exe       # Windows (use "rechan" on Linux and macOS)
`-- discimage/
    `-- game.bin     # or game.iso, file name doesn't matter
```

Keep only one disc image in `discimage`. On first launch, ReChan verifies the
disc version and uses its built-in extractor to prepare the required assets.
No separate extraction utility is needed.
Once assets are extracted the disc image folder can be deleted.

ReChan currently supports 64-bit x86 (`x86_64`) Windows and Linux, and Apple
Silicon (`arm64`) macOS. On macOS the renderer uses a native Metal backend. To
compile it yourself, see the [build guide](docs/BUILDING.md).

## Legal and Asset Notice

ReChan is an unofficial, free, non-commercial reimplementation project for
*Jackie Chan Stuntmaster*. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored
by, or approved by any original developer, publisher, license holder, or
rights holder.

The release package may include support files created specifically for ReChan
by the project author, including new text files, fonts, and textures. These are
newly authored ReChan files, not files from the PlayStation game. They do not
contain or redistribute content extracted or copied from the original game.

For the avoidance of doubt, **no original game assets, disc images, ROMs,
original game executables, videos, music, voice clips, textures, models,
levels, or other copyrighted PlayStation game data are included or distributed
with ReChan.**
The disc image placed in `discimage` is supplied by the user from their own
legally obtained copy. Its required assets are extracted locally on that
user's computer and are not part of the ReChan distribution.

*Jackie Chan Stuntmaster* and all related trademarks, copyrights, characters,
names, logos, assets, and game data remain the property of their respective
rights holders. Third-party libraries or assets included with ReChan remain
subject to their respective licenses.

## FAQ
**Is this a PS1 emulator?**  
No. ReChan is a reimplementation, the game logic is rewritten in C++ for PC and does not emulate PS1 hardware.

**Will this work with PAL versions?**
Currently only the NTSC-U version (**SLUS-00684**) is targeted. The PAL version is not supported and may differ in data layouts.

**Will this ever support original PS1 hardware?**  
No. That is not a goal of this project.

**Can I contribute?**  
Yes. Documentation, data formats, and behavior analysis are all welcome. See
the [build guide](docs/BUILDING.md) to get started.

## Crash reports

Fatal crashes create `minidumps/rechan-crash-<process-id>.txt` and ask the user
to open a GitHub issue. Windows also creates a matching `.dmp` minidump in that
folder. Debug reports append `rechan.log`; Release builds compile out logging
entirely. Reports are stored locally and are never uploaded automatically.

Maintainers can verify the packaged crash handler with
`--test-crash-reporter`. Set `RECHAN_CRASH_REPORTER_NO_DIALOG=1` when running
that check in automation.

## Changelog

Notable changes are listed in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## License
